#Project Title:CPU Schedular
#Project Description:A CPU scheduler is a crucial component of an operating
system responsible for managing the execution of processes. It decides which process
should utilize the CPU and for how long, ensuring efficient resource utilization. Through
algorithms and policies, it balances various factors like throughput, response time, and
fairness to optimize system performance. In essence, the CPU scheduler acts as a traffic
controller for the CPU, orchestrating the flow of processes for smooth operation.
